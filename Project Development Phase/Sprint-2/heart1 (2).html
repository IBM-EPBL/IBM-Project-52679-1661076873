                Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits.

                 The main challenge in today's healthcare is provision of best quality services and effective accurate diagnosis. Even if heart diseases are found as the prime source of death in the world in recent years, they are also the ones that can be controlled and managed effectively. The whole accuracy in management of a disease lies on the proper time of detection of that disease. Our proposed model makes an attempt to detect these heart diseases at early stage to avoid disastrous consequences.

            HEARTDISEASE PREDICTION-BEST ML APPROACHES
        </h1>
        <div class="tech">
            <h4>1. Random Forest Classifier</h4>
            <p>
                The random forest algorithm provides flexibility and robustness for classification tasks using tabular data, which few other standard models can. Given its simplicity and versatility, the random forest classifier is widely used for fraud detection, loan
                risk prediction, and predicting heart diseases.

        <div class="tech">
            <h4>2. K-Nearest Neighbors</h4>
            <p>
                As the name says, a k neighbors classifier takes a data point and finds k other data points nearest to it in the vector space. In a supervised fashion, KNN creates clusters of the data samples having the same target value. Whenever a new value needs to
                be classified, it uses a distance metric to assign it to one of the classes. For heart disease detection, there are only two classes that KNN needs to build. Thus, it is pretty robust and efficient for this task. Euclidean distance is
                one of the popular distance metrics used by KNN, but there are many more available.

        <div class="tech">
            <h4>3. Decision Tree classifier</h4>
            <p>
                Decision Trees are the individual models that make a random forest after ensembling. Each decision tree classifier uses the dataset's attributes to create a tree. As shown in the image below, the branches end up in the leaves that are made up of target
                values. Using visual components and an information gain index, the tree identifies the leading features of the labels of each class. Thus, the branches are created that maximize the information gained in each split and lead up to the leaf
                node of that class. Decision trees are fast and robust for disease prediction if the dataset has powerful features for a simple use-case.

            <h4>4. Support Vector Machines
            </h4>
            <p>
                A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a non-probabilistic classifier aiming to generate hyperplanes that divide the data points of two classes in the vector space. For N number of features and M targets, SVM creates M-1 N-dimensional hyperplanes
                that separate data points of different classes from each other. The image below shows how "support" vectors are calculated such that the margin (or distance) between the vectors of two classes is the most. SVM optimizes this margin metric
                to find the best hyperplane for all the categories.

            <h4>5. Artificial Neural Networks</h4>
            <p>
                An ANN is perhaps the most popular machine learning model in today's AI landscape, given its wide applications in deep learning in the form of convolutional neural networks. However, a normal ANN comprised of a handful of linear nodes can perform comparable
                to the best standard ML models. The architecture of a standard ANN is shown in the figure below. As we can see, the hidden layer is the most crucial part of an ANN, and is made up of several linear nodes.

            <P>
                Heart disease prediction is a necessity as well as exigent work in the medical field. The mortality rate can be reduced if the disease is recognized at the initial stages, and precautions and proper treatment are possible. The algorithms are tested using
                various features. Accurate forecasting of the diseases is the goal of the proposed method. The decision classifier approach proved to be very efficacious to predict the diseased using features like age, BMI, cholesterol, and more. Adding
                feature BMI improved the accuracy of prediction. Our project focuses on analyzing and designing a system where patients’
                real-time information can be processed and evaluated based on previous symptoms and current symptoms for different diseases.

                Chest pain is often associated with heart disease, many people with heart disease say they have a vague discomfort that isn't necessarily identified as pain. In general, chest discomfort related to a heart attack or another heart problem may be described
                by or associated with one or more of the following: Pressure, fullness, burning or tightness in your chest Crushing or searing pain that spreads to your back, neck, jaw, shoulders, and one or both arms Pain that lasts more than a few minutes,

            <p>
                Sex differences in pain perception are well-described, where female sex has higher somatic awareness compared to male sex. A comprehensive evaluation of sex and gender differences in pain includes proximate cause contributions of experiential
                (abuse, labor, and delivery), psychological (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress), genetic (X chromosome imprinting/Y chromosome), activational (steroid action in adulthood) and sociocultural (gender roles, gender role expectations).

            <h4>3.Exploration Of Max Heart Rate During The Chest Pain:</h4>
            <p>
                Your maximum heart rate is a calculation that helps you figure out what your ideal target heart rate is during exercise. When your heart rate is too fast, it’s called tachycardia. For adults, a fast heart rate is defined as above 100 bpm. Tachycardia can be caused by underlying health conditions like: anemia, congenital heart disease, heart disease that’s affecting blood flow, hyperthyroidism, injury to the heart, like from a heart attack. Taking illegal drugs or misusing prescription medications or non-prescription products (like diet supplements) may also cause your heart to beat too fast. Other, less serious reasons for a fast heart rate include: drinking caffeine, drinking alcohol, stress, physical exercise, pregnancy etc.

                Blood pressure is the force of blood flowing through a person’s blood vessels. Doctors calculate a person’s blood pressure using two measurements known as systolic and diastolic. Systolic blood pressure is the highest level of force at which the heart pumps blood around the body. Diastolic blood pressure is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. If either measurement is too high, it could mean a person has high blood pressure. If they are too low, it could suggest low blood pressure. Normal =Less than 120and Less than 80, Elevated =120–129 and Less than 80, Hypertension =stage 1 130–139 or 80–89, Hypertension =stage 2 140 or higher or 90 or higher, Hypertension crisis =Higher than 180 or Higher than 120...

                Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance, and there are two types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). If there is too much LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol in the bloodstream, it can build up in blood vessels, forming fatty deposits called plaques.These plaques can lead to other problems, including heart attacks and strokes. Total and LDL cholesterol levels should be low. But having more HDL, or “good,” cholesterol in the blood may reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Typically, males tend to have higher levels throughout their lives than females. A male’s cholesterol levels increase with age, and a female’s cholesterol levels rise after menopause.
